### React Assignment: 4 components with dummy texts

### *React Assignment – Build a Basic SPA*

* The node_modules folder could not upload because it was too large

*What to Do*

1. Create a fresh React app.

2. Make at least four section   components: for example
- Banner (like the top/hero section)
- About
- Products/Services
- Contact

3. Link all the sections inside App.js.

4. Ensure index.js connects to App.js.

5. Push your project to GitHub.

6. Submit your GitHub repo link at dev-champions.tech/forms.

*Notes*

- No styling yet — just simple text to show each section.

- Think of App.js as the main container and each section as a smaller part inside it.

- Make sure your GitHub repo is public.
